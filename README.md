# ⏰ Simple coming soon webpage

I'm thrilled to share my latest project with you – a simple coming soon webpage built with React, HTML, and CSS.
This project is designed to provide a clean and intuitive interface that informs visitors about the anticipated launch date of a desired webpage, while also offering a convenient newsletter space for updates and announcements.
With a focus on simplicity and functionality, this project showcases the power of modern web technologies (React) to deliver valuable information to users in an elegant and user-friendly manner.
Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even contribute to the project. Your support and engagement are greatly appreciated!
Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more exciting projects with you in the future!
